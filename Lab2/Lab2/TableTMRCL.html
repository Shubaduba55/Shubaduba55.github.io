Intro:

I want it all, I want it all,
I want it all, and I want it now

Verse 1:
Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper light on his feet
A young fighter screaming
With no time for doubt
With the pain and anger
Can't see a way out

Pre-Chorus:
"It ain't much I'm asking"
I heard him say
"Gotta find me a future
Move out of my way"

Chorus:
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

                            "I Want It All" is a song by British rock band Queen, featured on their 1989 studio album The Miracle. Written by guitarist and vocalist Brian May (but credited to Queen) and produced by David Richards, it was released as the first single from the album on 2 May 1989.
            "I Want It All" reached number three on the singles charts of the United Kingdom, Finland, Ireland and New Zealand, as well as on the US Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart.
            Elsewhere, it peaked at number two in the Netherlands and charted within the top 10 in Australia, Belgium, Germany, Norway and Switzerland. With its message about fighting for one's own goals it became an anti-apartheid protest song in South Africa.

            The song was first played live on 20 April 1992, three years after its release, during The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, performed by the three remaining members of Queen, with Roger Daltrey of The Who singing lead vocals and Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath playing rhythm guitar.
            Freddie Mercury himself never performed the song live, as he died in November 1991 from AIDS at the age of 45, and his final performance with Queen was at the end of The Magic Tour, at Knebworth Park on 9 August 1986. The record is sung mainly by Mercury, with May singing backing vocals on the choruses and a solo-and-duet bit with Mercury on the middle eight.
