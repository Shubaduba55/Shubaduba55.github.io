<i>Lyrics:</i>

Chorus:

Back chat, back chat
You burn all my energy
Back chat, back chat
Criticizing all you see
Back chat, back chat
Analysing what I say
Back chat, back chat
And you always get your way
Oh, yeah, see what you've done to me

Verse 1:

Back chat, back chat
It's driving me insane
Survival to the end
Knock you down, you come again
Talk back, talk back
You've got me on the wrack
Twisting ev'ry word I say
Wind me up and get your way
Fat chance I have of making a romance
If I'm ever goin' to win
Have to get the last word in

Take it from there
Twisting ev'ry word I say
Wind me up and let me play

            "Back Chat", written by the bass guitarist John Deacon, is the track most influenced by funk on the 1982 Queen album Hot Space. The song is a prime example of how Deacon was strongly pulling the band into dance orientated genres such as R&B, disco, and funk. It reached #40 on the UK Singles Chart, #18 in South Africa and a #19 entry in Ireland.

            The track was performed on the Hot Space Tour at a faster tempo, with a more rock-oriented arrangement. "Back Chat", the title, is an English idiom referring to "impertinent or impudent replies, especially to a superior". In a Rolling Stone album review, critic John Milward described the musical style of the song as: "a hot rock-funk tune, with guitar tracks as slick as an icy dance floor."

            In 2022 Far Out magazine named the song as one of the 40 best songs released in 1982 alongside such songs as Come On Eileen and 1999.
